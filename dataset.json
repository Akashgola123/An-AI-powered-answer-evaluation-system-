It manifests in both individual attitudes and institutional practices, from casual cultural judgments to discriminatory policies. In anthropology, overcoming ethnocentrism through cultural relativism—understanding cultures on their own terms without ranking them—is methodologically essential for accurate ethnographic research. While some degree of ethnocentrism may be psychologically natural in developing cultural identity, extreme forms contribute to prejudice, racism, xenophobia, and conflict.",

This technique allows archaeologists to establish relative chronological sequences, determine site formation processes, and understand temporal relationships between artifacts and features. Stratigraphic analysis involves identifying distinct layers (strata) through soil color, texture, and composition changes; documenting their relationships including intrusions and disturbances; and creating visual representations through section drawings and Harris matrices. While providing relative dating, stratigraphy is often combined with absolute dating methods like radiocarbon dating for comprehensive chronologies.",

Thematically, it explored youth culture, existential themes, and sociopolitical issues with naturalistic performances.

In winter, land cools faster, creating high pressure that pushes dry air toward oceans (winter/dry monsoon).

      "model_answer": "Feedback control is a fundamental control system approach where the actual output is measured and compared to the desired reference input (setpoint), with the difference (error) used to adjust the system's behavior. This closed-loop structure enables systems to automatically compensate for disturbances and internal parameter variations. Key components include sensors (measuring output), comparators (calculating error), controllers (processing error signals), and actuators (implementing control actions). Common implementations include proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, which responds to error magnitude, accumulation, and rate of change. Feedback systems balance performance metrics including stability, response speed, steady-state accuracy, and robustness against disturbances, with applications ranging from thermostats to aircraft stabilization systems.",

Inflectional morphology modifies words to express grammatical categories (tense, number, case, etc.) without changing the word's lexical category or core meaning (e.g., walk→walked, cat→cats). It typically occurs after derivation, applies consistently across word classes, and is required by syntactic context. Derivational morphology creates new lexemes through affixation or other processes, often changing word class (e.g., teach→teacher, happy→happiness) or significantly altering meaning. It may change pronunciation and stress patterns, applies less predictably, and is optional rather than syntactically required. These distinctions vary across languages, with some employing primarily one type over the other.",

It takes two main forms: homonymy, where identical forms have unrelated meanings (e.g., 'bank' as financial institution vs. riverside), and polysemy, where a word has related but distinct senses (e.g., 'head' of person, organization, bed). Context typically resolves lexical ambiguity through processes of disambiguation, though ambiguities may persist in headlines, jokes, or poetry where multiple readings are intentional. Computational approaches to resolving lexical ambiguity include statistical methods analyzing word co-occurrence and knowledge-based approaches using semantic networks or ontologies.

Prevalence measures the proportion of a population with a condition at a specific point (point prevalence) or period (period prevalence), expressed as a percentage or cases per 100,000 population. While incidence provides information about disease etiology and causation, prevalence indicates disease burden and resource needs. Mathematically, prevalence is approximately the product of incidence and average disease duration, meaning conditions with long duration but low incidence (e.g., diabetes) can have high prevalence, while conditions with high incidence but short duration (e.g., common cold) may have relatively low prevalence.",

      "model_answer": "Diversification is an investment risk management strategy that mixes various investments within a portfolio to reduce exposure to any single asset or risk. The fundamental principle is that a portfolio constructed of different asset types, sectors, geographies, or securities will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower risk than any individual investment within the portfolio. This approach works because assets respond differently to the same economic event; while some decline, others may remain stable or rise, dampening overall portfolio volatility. Modern Portfolio Theory quantifies this through correlation coefficients and the efficient frontier. Effective diversification encompasses multiple dimensions (asset classes, industries, geographies, market capitalizations, and time horizons) and must be regularly rebalanced, though it primarily protects against unsystematic (company/industry-specific) risk rather than systematic (market-wide) risk.",

Frames function as organizing principles that structure meaning by highlighting certain facets while minimizing others.
